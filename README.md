# Computational Intelligence Laboratory (CI-Lab)

Welcome to the Computational Intelligence Laboratory (CI-Lab) repository! This repository hosts a collection of course materials and implementations focusing on various aspects of computational intelligence and neural networks. Below is an overview of the key components included in this repository.

## Projects

### 1. Simple Perceptron
A basic implementation of a single-layer perceptron used for binary classification tasks.

### 2. Multi-Layer Perceptron
A more advanced neural network with multiple layers capable of solving complex classification and regression problems.

### 3. Clustering Algorithms
Various algorithms for clustering, including K-means clustering.

### 4. Radial Basis Function Neural Network
Implementation of Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks, commonly used for function approximation and pattern recognition.

### 5. Hopfield Network
A model of a recurrent artificial neural network that serves as a content-addressable memory system with binary threshold nodes.

### 6. Recurrent Neural Networks
RNNs designed for sequence prediction problems such as time series forecasting and natural language processing.

### 7. Identification Using Neural Networks
Techniques and implementations for system identification using neural network models.
